# Netflix_Data_Science_Project

In this project, i have applied the foundational data science skills like numPy, pandas and matplotlib to solve a real-world data science problem. I analysed the dataset to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
